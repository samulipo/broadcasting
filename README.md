### Sample animation files
- 50 agents; 1000 rounds; lambda = 0.01; beta = 200 
- ind_learners(50,100,1).mov: homogeneous individual learners: alpha = 100 (sd=1)
- soc_learners(50,1,1).mov: homogeneous social learners: alpha = 1 (sd=1)
- heterog_learners(45,100,1)(5,1,1).mov: heterogeneous population, 45 social & 5 individual
- Not particularly pretty at this point. The used animation library didn't support exporting, so had to do this with screen capture. Notice that (a) due to the rendering, you can't really see the gaussian noise (those graytones are too dark)  Furthermore, (b) landscape depletion does not show.
